this is a powershell 5.1 implementation of the Erlang C formula for call center staffing.

it uses [bigint] to handle large numbers in the agent field due to factorials in the wait probability method.

the class is intended to be created for a segment with defined parameters then call the basic export method to get resultant calculations.
